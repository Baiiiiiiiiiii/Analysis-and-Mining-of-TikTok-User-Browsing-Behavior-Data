# Analysis-and-Mining-of-TikTok-User-Browsing-Behavior-Data
Analysis and Mining of TikTok User Video Browsing Behavior Records, including information on who is watching, whose work they are viewing, and related data (such as user's city), along with descriptions of behaviors (such as whether they liked the video). Browsing behavior involves different active entities, such as users, authors, and works. By synthesizing browsing data, specific characteristics are formulated to describe the features of these entities. Data analysis methods are employed to statistically analyze browsing behavior data, identifying features of different entities, and performing data analysis and mining on these features to serve business optimization and other purposes.
